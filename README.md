## Motivation

This repo was created as I did not find any resources where I could download the said image dataset in a format which can be operated on with ease. The programs contained here are very simple conversion programs, feel free to use, modify, copy them as you deem fit.
The fully converted dataset will be published soon.

## Dataset Details
The following datasets are used in the programs which converted them into NumPy matrices for ease of use. The original datasets may be found in the following links:

### Original Data
1. Full Data:   https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/data                     ~42 GB
2. Sample Data: https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/sample                   ~ 2 GB
3. NIH Box:     https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC/folder/36938765345

### Converted Data
1.  Sample Data (NumPy Format):  https://buffalo.app.box.com/s/5qdzwn881ew5bj21kudaw05f6lgibkvn   ~5.5 GB
    The above dataset is stored in tar split tar archives and should be combined to get the <b>npy</b> file.
